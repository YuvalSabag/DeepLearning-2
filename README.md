## Facial Recognition Using One-shot Siamese Neural Network

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) using a **Siamese Neural Network** architecture for facial recognition  
with **one-shot learning**. The network is trained to determine whether two facial images belong to the same person.  
This approach is particularly effective in scenarios where data for each class is limited.  
The implementation utilizes **PyTorch Lightning** and the **Labelled Faces in the Wild (LFW-a)** dataset, focusing on the core concepts   
of **similarity learning** and **feature extraction**.
